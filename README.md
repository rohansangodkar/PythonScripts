# Python Automation Scripts

This repository contains a collection of Python automation scripts that I have written. These scripts aim to automate various tasks and improve efficiency in different areas.

## Scripts

### CodeStandardChecker.py

This script checks the coding standards of components such as SQL, COBOL, Copybooks, etc. by performing static code analysis. It helps ensure consistent and maintainable code by highlighting potential issues and deviations from the defined standards.

### PackageCreationUtility.py

This script creates a standard folder structure & zips it. The zipped file is a pre-requisite for the further package creation process. This script takes numerous inputs from the user such as various local IBM Synergy paths, PR# (change numbers), destination folder etc.

## Usage

Feel free to explore and utilize these scripts according to your requirements. Each script is self-contained and can be run independently. Before running the scripts, please make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed.

## Contributing

Contributions, improvements, and suggestions are welcome! If you have an automation script that you would like to add to this repository, feel free to submit a pull request. Please ensure that your script follows best practices, is well-documented, and thoroughly tested.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to acknowledge the resources, libraries, and communities that have contributed to the development of these automation scripts. Their collective efforts make automation in Python more accessible and powerful.
